Dungeon
-------

Goal: To create a detailed, highly interactive D&D game, accessible on
      modern platforms, both single and multi-player. Graphics are secondary
      to game play.

Platform Ideas:
  - coffeescript / javascript
    - advantage: works in a browser or via node.js
    - disadvantage: not sure how this would scale
      node.js should scale very well

  - redis for regular lookups
  - postgres for persistence

  - distributed architecture, scale to hundreds of machines


  - wait, what am i trying to do?

  - single player game
  - ios or desktop
    -> c library can do both?
    -> ruby?
    -> javascript/web?
      -> why not?
          slowness? capacity? interactivity?
          migrate to multiplayer?
